## Ashley and Cameron
* Code should be thoroughly commented to explain the steps taken by the author.
* Repository etiquette and organization should be discussed early in the project to maintain uniformity. A README.md file can outline etiquette and other agreed upon practices as well as introducing people to the contents of the repository.
* Soft code the file path names within notebooks so that they can be easily switched between users.
* Clearly state when you use AI agents to write your code.
* Document your progress and share updates with your team as they happen. This includes writing meaningful commit messages, updating markdowns, and data sharing.
* Do not work on the main branch to avoid overwriting people's work. Clean up branches as they get merged into the main. Have another person review your commits before merging.
* Keep personal emails, passwords, and data out of the repository.
* Cite your sources for data, code, etc. Provide clear instructions for how to access data.

## Best Practices:
1. Everyone should be clear on what their role is. Avoid confusion.
2. Maintain uniformity in protocol: file names, heirarchies, commit convention. Consistent and clear documentation,
so that everyone can navigate it properly.
3. Try to organize proper meetings so we can hash out topics with the group face to face.
4. Help each other out, making fixes when you can and notifying people who may be working on those sections.
Create frequent and informative branches so everyone is up to date with what you're doing.
5. COMMENT OUT CODE. Not everyone will understand your thought process.
6. Practicing presentations beforehand, so that group members don't have to improvise.
## Sophia and Dahlia Collaboration Best Practices
1. Having a discussion to assess everyone in the group's existing strengths and decided what roles would be best for each person. 
2. Repository etiquette: Everyone in the group works in their own branch and uses pull-requests approved by another group member. 
    - Maintaining a markdown file in a group repository, explaining where the project is at and how to interpret existing code.
3. Setting up weekly meetings to create goals for the next week. 
    - Assigning specific tasks for each person and checking in on how peoples current tasks are going.

## Best Practices for Collaboration
- Use a team project git hub repository
    - Maintain clear communication and team member roles to ensure documents do not have conflicts
    - Use branches instead of committing to main
    - Ask other members to merge your pull request
    - Update the ReadMe regularly and make sure all members are up-to-date on it
    - Leave comments throughout notebooks to ensure others can easily follow the code
- Clear and open communications can include creating group chats with all team members, being honest, and clear to-do list
- Maintain open-mindedness to new ideas/methods and be willing to compromise and listen to others
### Group: Olivia Murdock and Sofia Suhinin
_What guidelines should individuals follow when working in a team on a ML project?_

- Team expertise
    - Putting together a team with different expertise (not necessarily all coding experience require) so each person can contribute in their own way - and learn at the same time!
    - Sharing your methodology with the group so others can learn
- Git workflow 
    - Establish a clean git workflow via branch deployment, pull requests, merges and commits
    - Do not accept pull requests without reviewing the code
    - Do not fork - unless that is your desired method (not advised)
    - Delete branches frequently 
    - Do not overwrite other peoples code
    - When in doubt - ask!
- Communication
    - Make a group chat with your team!
    - Update on progress
    - Set clear goals and timelines for individuals and group
    - Make sure task designation is clear so that two people do not do the same thing - for example, two people writing the same block of code and not realising
    - Meet on Zoom!

## Christina and David

- Commit to git regularly and submit pull requests that should be approved by others.
- Schedule meetings and discuss what you need to accomplish regularly. (Almahmoud et al. 2021)
  - Establish what criteria will be used to assess the performance of the model and the group.
  - What kind of role will each team member fill. 

- Establish rules for your git repository.
  - How should pull requests be completed?
    - Someone other than the committer needs to review and accept the pull request.
  - How much detail should be in a commit or pull request message?
    - The message should explain where the commit is going, what it's doing, and how it might interact or change the existing program.
  - What criteria should be used for reviewing code being added to the git?
    - comments, markdown files, etc.

- Github Best Practices https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea3684
  - Implement Git's Large File Storage so that large files or many files exceeding git's default storage capacity can be added to a repository.


## Michael and Lucy
- Annotate: When you write up shared code, annotate it well! Not everyone who clones your repository, or even works in your group, will understand your code by reading it. In this case, clear documentation and annotation can save a lot of time.
    - Ex: Lucy's group selected a model by looking at the repository from a similar paper -- yet the GitHub repository was pretty bare-bones. If they had better documentation and code annotation, that would have saved time in Lucy's group interpretation and accelerated science in this subdiscipline.

- Divide and Conquer: When working in a group with a diversity of tasks and data, divide and conquer! You can save a lot of time if you let each person become an expert in a specific part of the project.
    - Ex: Michael's group drew on data from four different instruments, each with their own APIs. Rather than one person figuring out the right data pull scripts, which would have been time consuming, each person became an expert in their instrument. Once all the data had been pre-processed, one person combined it into a training data set. This allowed us to make progress in parallel without working over other's work.

- Etiquette: Don't mess with someone else's code without first talking to them about it! Either clone it or branch so you don't overwrite someone else's workflow that you might not understand.

- Communication: Talk about everyone's skills and strengths as soon as possible. This allows you to be on the same page and understand and distribute in a way that will be equitable and efficient.
    - Ex: In Lucy's group, some were quite experienced in coding while others were new to Python. The task of writing a particular script might take 30 minutes for an expert and 6 hours for another group member. While everyone should develop skills through the project, it's okay to divide up the work in ways that make sense for each member's skillset.

### Volcano Group - Matt, Hiroto, Jose
1. ease of communication - being able to communicate/organize on the fly through communication applications (ie whatsapp) has proved crucial
2. delegation of capabilities - playing off the strength of various team members and their past experience is vital for project success
3. consistent meetings - meetings involving all members in order to evaluate progress and select next steps
4. data compartamentalization - seperation of various stages of our model into different data storage applications has helped us deal with the large file sizes and the various inputs and outputs our model produces

## Justin 
1. Try to work through branches instead of commiting everything to the main branch 
2. Don't merge your own code. Any pull requests should be reviewed by other group members so that the quality is up to everyone's standard 
3. Don't use file paths that are specific to you. Instead, write the file paths in ways that can be run by anyone without having to edit anything
4. Add comments to explain what and why each code is doing in order to save time in the future when debugging

## Mary Orrand
*Project: Predicting ocean pCO₂ from satellite remote sensing*

1. **Set up a clear folder structure from the start.** I organized my repository into separate folders for notebooks, data, plots, and documentation. I also numbered the notebook folders by workflow step (00_data_download, 01_exploration, etc.) so anyone looking at the project could follow the order of operations without me explaining it.
2. **Write a good README and keep it updated.** I wrote a README that explains what the project is, where each file lives, and how to run things in order. This way if someone else (or future me) comes back to the project, they can get up to speed quickly.
3. **Don't put large data files in git.** My satellite and buoy CSV files were too big for GitHub. Instead, I wrote a guide explaining which notebooks to run to regenerate all the processed data from scratch — so the data doesn't need to live in the repo.
4. **Use branches and pull requests, even when working solo.** I worked on feature branches instead of committing directly to main. This kept the main branch clean and made it easy to undo things if something went wrong.
5. **Document your decisions, not just your code.** I kept markdown files explaining why I made certain choices — like why I used a 12 km bounding box for satellite data, or why I required at least 4 observations per day. Comments in code explain *what* is happening, but separate docs explain *why*.
